                <h2>Folklore</h2>
                Critics mostly categorize Folklore as an alternative, indie folk, and electro-folk album departing from
                the pop maximalism and synth-driven sound of Swift's previous works. It also incorporates indie rock,
                electronica, dream pop, country, and folk rock elements.

                        <h2>The 1</h2>
                        <p>I'm doing good, I'm on some new sh!t
                            Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
                            I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
                            I hit the ground running each night
                            I hit the Sunday matine
                            You know the greatest films of all time were never made
                            I guess you never know, never know
                            And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
                            And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
                            And it's alright now.

                        <p>
                            Vintage tee, brand new phone
                            High heels on cobblestones
                            When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                            Sequin smile, black lipstick
                            Sensual politics
                            When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                            But I knew you
                            Dancin' in your Levi's
                            Drunk under a streetlight, I
                            I knew you
                            Hand under my sweatshirt
                            Baby, kiss it better, I
                            And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
                            Under someone's bed
                            You put me on and said I was your favorite.

                                Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train
                                It was sunny
                                Her saltbox house on the coast
                                Took her mind off St. Louis
                                Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
                                And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorc√©e do it?"
                                The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
                                There's only so far new money goes
                                They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
                                Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
                                The doctor had told him to settle down.
